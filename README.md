# Abalone

Abalone is a type of marine mollusk found in coastal waters, primarily known for its edible meat and its shell, which is often used for decorative purposes. The shell of the abalone is iridescent, displaying a range of colors, which is why it’s sometimes used in jewelry or as a decorative item. The mollusk itself is typically a slow-moving creature that clings to rocks in underwater environments.

Abalone is also significant in culinary traditions, particularly in places like Asia and the Mediterranean, where it’s considered a delicacy. The meat is prized for its texture and flavor, often prepared in various dishes like soups, stir-fries, or even served raw as sushi.


## Dataset Information

Additional Information

Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements.  The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task.  Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age.  Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.

From the original data examples with missing values were removed (the majority having the predicted value missing), and the ranges of the continuous values have been scaled for use with an ANN (by dividing by 200).
